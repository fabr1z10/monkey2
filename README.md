# Platforms

So far I've compiled glib3 succesfully on the following platforms:

* Windows 10 + Visual Studio Community 2022 (64 bit) Version 17.13.4
* Linux + gcc 7.4.0

# Get the source code

You can also clone the repository using the command:

    git clone https://github.com/fabr1z10/glib3.git

# Dependencies

The library requires the following packages installed in your system. More details on how to install each of them for specific platforms in the #compiling section.

* GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
* GLFW (https://www.glfw.org/)
* glm (https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
* PNG library (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
* Python (https://www.python.org)

You also need CMake to build the engine.

# Compiling

## Windows details

Below you can find some instructions on how to install the dependencies on Windows. In this section, {VC Root} refers to the root where your C++ compiler in installed. For instance, in my setup it is in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.23.28105`

### GLEW
* Go to http://glew.sourceforge.net/ 
* Get the windows binaries
* Copy the `glew32.dll` in `bin/Release/x64` into `c:/windows/System32` 
* Copy `glew32.lib` and `glew32s.lib` in `lib/Release/x64` into `{VC Root}/lib/x64`
* Copy the content of the include folder in `{VC Root}/include`

### GLFW

Get the source code from https://www.glfw.org/, and unzip it. Open up a MS Visual Studio command prompt and in the root folder type:
    
    cd build
    cmake .. 
    MSBuild GLFW.sln /p:Configuration=Release
    cmake --install .

You probably need to tell `Cmake` where to find GLFW, for instance:

	set(glfw3_DIR "C:/Program Files (x86)/GLFW/lib/cmake/glfw3")


### GLM

This is a header-only library. Download the latest release from https://glm.g-truc.net. Copy the `glm` include folder (the one containing `glm.hpp`) in `{VC Root}/include`.

### ZLIB (required by PNG library)

Go to https://www.zlib.net/ and download the source code. Unzip it, open a MS Visual Studio prompt with admin rights and type in the following:

    md build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release

This should build and install the library in a proper location (should be in `c:\Program Files (x86)\zlib` or the like).

### PNG

Go to http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html and get the latest source code. Unzip it, open a MS Visual Studio prompt and cd to the root folder of the unzipped file. Type the following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    msbuild libpng.sln /p:Configuration=Release
You should now have a `Release` folder inside the `Build` folder containing the binary files. Copy `libpng16.lib` and `libpng16_static.lib` into `{VC Root}\lib\x64`. Copy `libpng16.dll` into `c:\windows\system32`. Also copy `png.h`, `pngconf.h` and `build\pnglibconf.h` in `{VC Root}\include`.

### JPG

Get the `JPEG` lib package from https://www.nuget.org/packages/libjpeg/.

### FreeType

Go to the Freetype main page https://www.freetype.org/ and download the latest stable release. Unzip it, and in a MS Visual Studio prompt (run it as administrator) type in the following:

    md build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=TRUE
	msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release 

This will build the library and install it in the proper location, typically in a `freetype` folder in `C:\Program Files (x86)` or similar.

### YAML

You can find this library at https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp. Download and unzip the latest release, then in the root folder type:

	md build && cd build
	cmake ..
	msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release

### Python

Go to https://www.python.org/ and grab and install the latest release for Windows. This should install all the components required by the engine.
